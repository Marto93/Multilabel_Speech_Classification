# Multilabel_Speech_Classification
In this challange the aim was to create a ML model able to classify 35 different types of audio files (.wav). To solve the task we used different types of ANN architectures (MLP - CNN and RNN). COnsidering that the accuracy was the metric to focus on, the RNN resulted the best model.
